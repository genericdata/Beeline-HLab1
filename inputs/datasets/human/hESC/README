Downloaded STRING edges (v11) using the TFs. Commands used:

# Uploaded the following file to STRING
cut -f 1 -d ',' ExpressionData.csv  | tail -n +2 > tfs.txt

# exported the string_interactions.tsv file from STRING 
# reformatted to match our refNetwork.csv files
f=refNetwork-string-400.csv; echo "Gene1,Gene2,combined_score" > $f; cut -f 1,2,15 string_interactions.tsv  | tail -n +2 | sed "s/\t/,/g" >> $f; head $f

# also used a higher score cutoff
awk -F ,  '{if($3 >= 0.7) {print $0}}' refNetwork-string-400.csv > refNetwork-string-700.csv
